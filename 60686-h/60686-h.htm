<h2>ARCHIBALD MARSHALL</h2></div>


<p>On a mellow day in the early autumn of
the year 1900, I sat on an old wooden
bench in the open air with an English
gentleman, and listened to his conversation
with a mixture of curiosity and reverence.
The place was one of the fairest counties of
England, the town on the other side of a screen
of trees was Dorchester, and my seat-mate was
Thomas Hardy. I remember his saying without
any additional emphasis than the weight of
the words, that the basis of every novel should
be a story. In considering this remark, which
came, not from a doctrinaire, but from a master
of long and triumphant experience, I could not
help thinking that what seems axiomatic is
often belied by a majority of instances. Thus,
we church-members would agree that religion
must take the first place in our lives; yet a
disinterested observer, who should begin at the
other end of the proposition and examine our
lives merely to discover what actually did take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the first place therein, might conceivably miss
the element of religion altogether. In the same
way, while it would theoretically seem that
every novel must be a story, an honest critic
who should examine the total product of prose
fiction for any given year in the twentieth century,
might, in a large number of cases, easily
fail to find any story at all.</p>

<p>As we look back over the history of the English
novel, it would appear that every permanent
work of fiction has been a great story.
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, <i>Clarissa</i>, <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Humphry
Clinker</i>, <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>, <i>Esmond</i>, <i>David Copperfield</i>, <i>The
Mill on the Floss</i>, <i>Richard Feverel</i>, <i>The Return
of the Native</i>, <i>Treasure Island</i>, <i>The Last of
the Mohicans</i>, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, <i>Huckleberry
Finn</i>, although they represent various shades
of realism and romanticism, have all been primarily
stories, in which we follow the fortunes
of the chief actors with steady interest. These
books owe their supremacy in fiction&mdash;at least,
most of them do&mdash;to a combination of narrative,
character, and style; every one of them, if
given in colloquial paraphrase to a group of
men around a camp-fire, would be rewarded
with attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the very thing that gives a drama
or a novel immediate currency makes it smell
of mortality; by taking advantage of some
hotly-discussed social question, general interest
is awakened; but when the question is obsolete,
what becomes of the work of art? I shall not
venture to make a prediction; but I think it is
at least possible that some of the earlier plays
of Ibsen, like <i>The Pretenders</i>, may outlast some
of the later ones, like <i>Ghosts</i>; the later ones
blaze with the flames of public debate, the
earlier reflect the light of the stars.</p>

<p>Of all forms of literature, the novel has suffered
most by its desertion of art for propaganda.
It has been debased by its popularity.
It lends itself so easily as a channel for political,
social or religious oratory. Every theorist
uses it as a megaphone. Although novels are
as common as grasshoppers, good stories are
scarce. Now this desertion of art for propaganda
is founded on the fallacy that a work of
pure fiction cannot stand or ought not to stand
by itself, but should lean on politics, social
reform, science, or theology for support. We
do not insist on a thesis in sculpture or music
or painting or poetry. There have been, indeed,
many attempts to turn Pegasus into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
cart-horse; and unfortunately the attempt is
almost invariably successful.</p>

<p>I prefer novels that express the opinions of
the characters in the story to those that express
the opinions of the author. I do not mean that
all novels ought to be impersonal; such a result,
even when most ardently desired by the novelist,
is impossible of achievement. The work of
every true artist reflects his personality, and is,
in a sense, subjective. Even the coldest novels
betray their makers' sympathies, and the standpoint
from which they regard the world. But
there is a difference between having ideas and
arguing a case. Women who have ideas are
always more interesting than those who have
only opinions.</p>

<p>Why is it that so many novelists write their
best books early in their careers? Is it not
sometimes because the original impelling artistic
impulse becomes dulled in contact with
society, and thoughts take the place of thought?
The thorns of this world spring up and choke
them. It is by no accident that <i>The Mill
on the Floss</i> is a greater novel than <i>Daniel
Deronda</i>.</p>

<p>The most enduring novels come from the
silent depths in a writer's soul, not from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
turbulent shallows. To live deeply is easier
in a country where deep living has been done
for centuries than in a country whose human
history is brief. If we should really feel
chagrined by America's native contribution to
literature in comparison with that of Europe,
we might justifiably console ourselves by comparing
America with Australia. Surely one
reason why the British today write novels
rather better than the Americans, is because
their roots go down deeper into the rich soil
of the past. Men of genius are scarce in any
locality, and I am not at this moment thinking
of them; but I am constantly surprised at the
large number of contemporary novels produced
in Great Britain whose literary style bears the
unmistakable stamp of distinction. There are
leaders, whose names are known everywhere;
there are men and women who might conceivably
be leaders if they lived out of Europe.
The best reason why many admirable
twentieth century works of prose fiction in
England fail to attract general attention is
because the level of excellence is so high.</p>

<h2>II</h2></div>


<p>H. G. Wells is not the hero of this
book. I am holding my roses for a
figure that has not yet appeared upon
my little stage. But the career of Mr. Wells,
whose novels have almost every quality except
charm, is interesting to contemplate. That he
is a born novelist was clear to me so early as
the year 1895, when one of his best stories
appeared&mdash;<i>The Wheels of Chance</i>. Not long
after came the novels of science and socialism
that carried his name around the world; he
was discussed in the salons of Paris and in
the prisons of Siberia. His books were all
busy, noisy, talkative, restless; they reflected
in their almost truculent mental aggressiveness
the mass of undigested and indigestible quasi-scientific
fodder that perhaps disturbs more
than it nourishes the twentieth century stomach;
they made many readers fondly believe
they were living the intellectual life. I mistakenly
supposed he would keep up this squirrel-cage
activity to the end of his days; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mistakenly supposed in all this clatter he was
incapable of hearing the voice of the spirit. I
used to think that if all the world suddenly became
religious except one man, that man would
be H. G. Wells.</p>

<p>The war, which diverted the energies of so
many quiet thinkers to matters of immediate
and practical efficiency, produced a rather different
effect upon this interesting man. He
began to regard things that are temporal in
relation to those of eternal import. He became
converted&mdash;I have no hesitation in using the
good old word&mdash;and while I can see no evidence
of conviction of sin, for humility is not his most
salient characteristic, he did come to believe
and believes now, that religion ought to be the
motive power of man. What direction his
ideas may take in the future I cannot divine;
but I am thankful for his conversion, if only
for the reason that it inspired him to produce
a masterpiece, <i>Mr. Britling Sees It Through</i>.
This novel is not only far and away his best
book, it is the ablest work of fiction about the
war that I have read. But it owes its eminence
not to its accurate reporting of the course of
social history during the war, for after all, the
much admired hockey-game is not much higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
than major journalism, but rather to the profound
sense of spiritual values which is the
core of the book.</p>

<p>I regard it as unfortunate that Mr. Wells
felt it necessary to follow up the triumph of
this tale with a treatise on theology called <i>God
the Invisible King</i>, and with a propagandist
novel, called <i>The Soul of a Bishop</i>. For the
last-named book illustrates all the faults of its
species, as well as the cardinal sin against art.
<i>Mr. Britling Sees It Through</i> is religious; <i>The
Soul of a Bishop</i> is sectarian. And <i>God the
Invisible King</i>, while it should be read with
sympathy for its author's sincerity and newly-found
idealism, has all the arrogance and cock-sureness
of an old-fashioned theologian without
the preliminary years of devoted learning
that gave the old-fashioned one some right to
a hearing, provided of course he could induce
any one to listen to him. No orthodox evangelist
has ever been more sure of God than Mr.
Wells. The novel was properly named <i>Mr.
Britling Sees It Through</i>; and we might with
equal propriety name the treatise, <i>Mr. Britling
Sees Through It</i>.</p>

<p>Strange and unfortunate that Mr. Wells
should think that the religious element in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Britling needed additional emphasis. A work
of art founded on eternal verities will accomplish
more for the cause of religion than any
tract. Solely from the moral point of view,
<i>Anna Karenina</i> is a more impressive book than
most of its author's subsequent exhortations.</p>

<p><i>The Soul of a Bishop</i> is not a realistic novel,
for there is no real character in it. It is
already on its way to limbo, along with <i>Robert
Elsmere</i> and <i>The Inside of the Cup</i>. But it is
an excellent illustration of the fate that awaits
an artist when he sacrifices the truth of art for
the enforcement of personal opinion. There
was a time when the excitement over the question
of trades-unions produced by <i>Put Yourself
in His Place</i> was at fever heat; but that novel
today is almost forgotten, while <i>The Cloister
and the Hearth</i> will be read by generation after
generation, simply because it is a great story.</p>

<h2>III</h2></div>


<p>In order to illustrate what I mean by a
realistic novelist whose happiest effects are
gained by writing good stories with real
characters, I know of no better choice among
contemporaries than Archibald Marshall. He
is an artist of such dignity and refinement that
only twice in his career has he written a novel
that had for its main purpose something other
than truth to life; in each of these two attempts
the result was a failure.</p>

<p>I know how difficult it is to "recommend"
novels to hungry readers, for I have written
prescriptions to alleviate many kinds of mental
trouble, yes, and physical ailments too; but how
can I be sure that the remedy will in every
"case" be effective? I know that <i>Treasure
Island</i> cured me of an attack of tonsillitis and
that <i>Queed</i> cured me of acute indigestion; a
United States naval officer informed me that
he recovered from jaundice simply by reading
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. These are facts; but
what assurance have I that other sufferers can
try these prescriptions with reasonable hope?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Yet I have no hesitancy in recommending
Archibald Marshall to any group of men or
women or to any individual of mature growth.
One scholar of sixty years of age told me that
these novels had given him a quite new zest
in life; and I myself, who came upon them on
one of the luckiest days of my existence, confidently
affirm the same judgment. Of the
numerous persons that I have induced to read
these books, I have met with only one sceptic;
this was a shrewd, sharp-minded woman of
eighty, who declared with a hearty laugh that
she found them insupportably tame. I understand
this hostility, for when girls reach the
age of eighty, they demand excitement.</p>

<p>Those who are familiar with Mr. Marshall's
work and life will easily discover therein echoes
of his own experience. He is an Englishman
by birth and descent, familiar with both town
and country. He was born on the sixth of September,
1866, and received in his home life and
preliminary training plenty of material which
appeared later in the novels. His father came
from the city, like the father in <i>Abington
Abbey</i>; he himself was graduated from Trinity
College, Cambridge, like the son of <i>Peter
Binney</i>; it was intended but not destined that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he should follow his father's business career,
and he worked in a city office like the son of
Armitage Brown; he went to Australia like the
hero's sister in <i>Many Junes</i>; he made three
visits to America, but fortunately has not yet
written an American novel; he studied theology
with the intention of becoming a clergyman in
the Church of England, like so many young
men in his stories; in despair at finding a
publisher for his work, he became a publisher
himself, and issued his second novel, <i>The House
of Merrilees</i>, which had as much success as it
deserved; he tried journalism before and during
the war; he lived in two small Sussex
towns with literary associations, Winchelsea
and Rye, in the latter from 1908 to 1913; then
until 1917 his home was in Switzerland; he
has now gone back to the scene of his university
days, Cambridge.</p>

<p>In 1902 he was married and lived for some
time in Beaulieu (pronounced Bewly) in the
New Forest, faithfully portrayed in <i>Exton
Manor</i>. He spent three happy years there
planning and making a garden, like the young
man in <i>The Old Order Changeth</i>. Although
his novels are filled with hunting and shooting,
he is not much of a sportsman himself, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
content only to observe. He loves the atmosphere
of sport rather than sport. His favourite
recreations are walking, reading, painting,
and piano-playing, and the outdoor flavour
of his books may in part be accounted for by
the fact that much of his writing is done in the
open air.</p>

<p>Like many another successful man of letters,
his first step was a false start; for in 1899 he
produced a novel called <i>Peter Binney, Undergraduate</i>,
which has never been republished in
America, and perhaps never will be. This is a
topsy-turvy book, where an ignorant father
insists on entering Cambridge with his son;
and after many weary months of coaching, succeeds
in getting his name on the books. The
son is a steady-headed, unassuming boy, immensely
popular with his mates; the father,
determined to recapture his lost youth, disgraces
his son and the college by riotous living,
and is finally expelled. The only good things in
the book are the excellent pictures of May Week
and some snap-shots at college customs; but the
object of the author is so evident and he has
twisted reality so harshly in order to accomplish
it, that we have merely a work of distortion.</p>

<p>For six years our novelist remained silent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and he never returned to the method of reversed
dynamics until the year 1915, when he
published <i>Upsidonia</i>, another failure. Once
again his purpose is all too clear; possibly irritated
by the exaltation of slum stories and
the depreciation of the characters of the well-to-do
often insisted upon in such works, he
wrote a satire in the manner of <i>Erewhon</i>, and
called it a novel. Here poverty and dirt are
regarded as the highest virtues, and the possession
of wealth looked upon as the sure and
swift road to social ostracism. There is not a
gleam of the author's true skill in this book,
mainly because he is so bent on arguing his
case that exaggeration triumphs rather too
grossly over verisimilitude. He is, of course,
trying to write nonsense; a mark that some
authors have hit with deliberate aim, while
perhaps more have attained the same result
with less conscious intention. Now Mr.
Marshall cannot write nonsense even when
he tries; and failure in such an effort is
particularly depressing. He is at his best
when his art is restrained and delicate; in
<i>Upsidonia</i> he drops the engraving-tool and
wields a meat-axe. Let us do with <i>Peter
Binney</i> and with <i>Upsidonia</i> what every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
reader has done; let us try to forget them,
remembering only that two failures in fifteen
books is not a high proportion.</p>

<p>Of the remaining thirteen novels, two attained
only a partial success; and the reason
is interesting. These two are <i>The House of
Merrilees</i> and <i>Many Junes</i> (1908). The former
was written in 1901 but publishers would
none of it, and it did not wear a print dress
until 1905. Meanwhile the author was trying
his hand at short stories, for which his method
of work is not particularly fitted, his skill
being in the development of character rather
than in the manufacture of incident. He did,
however, publish a collection of these tales in
one volume, called <i>The Terrors</i>, which appeared
in 1913, their previous separate publication
covering a period of sixteen years. They
are amazingly unequal in value; some are excellent,
and others trivial. This volume is out
of print, and whether any of the contents may
be rescued from oblivion is at present problematical.
It is interesting, however, that he,
at the outset of his career, supposed that invention,
rather than observation, was his trump
card. The realism of <i>The House of Merrilees</i>
is mixed with melodrama and mystery; these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
are, in the work of a dignified artist, dangerous
allies, greater liabilities than assets. In a personal
letter he confesses that this artificial plot
hampered him; but he goes on to say, "the
range of scene and character in that book is
something that I have never been able to catch
since." He has since&mdash;with only one relapse&mdash;happily
forsaken artificially constructed
mysteries for the deepest mystery of all&mdash;the
human heart. In <i>Many Junes</i>, a story
that will be reprinted in America in 1919,
we have pictures of English country life of
surpassing loveliness; we have an episode
as warm and as fleeting as June itself; we
have a faithful analysis of the soul of a strange
and solitary man, damned from his birth by
lack of decision. But the crisis in the tale is
brought about by an accident so improbable
that the reader refuses to believe it. The moment
our author forsakes reality he is lost; it
is as necessary for him to keep the truth as it
was for Samson to keep his hair. Furthermore,
this is the only one of Mr. Marshall's
books that has a tragic close&mdash;and his art cannot
flourish in tragedy, any more than a native
of the tropics can live in Lapland. The bleak
air of lost illusion and frustrated hope, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
which the foremost living novelist, appropriately
named, finds his soul's best climate, is
not favourable to Archibald Marshall.</p>

<p>The "relapse" mentioned in the preceding
paragraph occurred in the year 1912, when he
published a long and wildly exciting novel,
called <i>The Mystery of Redmarsh Farm</i>. This
has all the marks of a "best-seller" and went
through several editions in England, though it
has not yet been reprinted in America. I regard
the writing of this book as the most dangerous
moment in Mr. Marshall's career, for
its immediate commercial success might easily
have tempted him to continue in the same vein,
and if he had, he would have sunk to the level
of a popular entertainer, and lost his position
among British novelists of the past and present.
Curiously enough, it came between two of his
best works in the Clinton series, <i>The Eldest
Son</i> (1911) and <i>The Honour of the Clintons</i>
(1913). Maybe the chilling reception given to
his finest stories drove him to a cheaper style
of composition. Maybe his long second visit
to Australia, where he saw and shared experiences
quite unlike his English environment,
made him try his hand at mystery and crime.
In 1911 he had published <i>Sunny Australia</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
result of a sojourn on that continent, whither
he had gone as special commissioner for the
<i>Daily Mail</i>. There is a good deal of superficial
cleverness in <i>The Mystery of Redmarsh Farm</i>;
its plot is elaborate, with a flavour of <i>Lohengrin</i>;
the beautiful lonely maiden's young
brother is stolen by a villain and rescued by
a young hero who is appropriately named
Knightly; a misunderstanding separates the
girl and her lover, who sails away to Australia.
Unlike Lohengrin, however, he returns, and all
is well. There is a conventional detective, and
a murder trial and a shipwreck and a recognition
scene&mdash;I kept looking back to the title page
to see if the author really was Archibald
Marshall. It is as though Joseph Conrad
should write like Marie Corelli. Yet although
some of the characters are unreal and the plot
artificial and the villain theatrical, the environment,
whether in England or in Australia,
is as accurately painted as in Mr. Marshall's
best stories. He will not write of places that
he has not seen. When the gypsies are found,
they are found in the New Forest; and any
one who reads this yarn immediately after
<i>Sunny Australia</i>, will see that these distant
scenes are correctly described.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1906, and in the novel
<i>Richard Baldock</i>, that he revealed his
power. This book, which will make its first
American appearance in the autumn of 1918,
contains a story so absorbing that it is only in
the retrospect that one realizes the vitality of
its characters and the delicacy of its art. There
are no heroes and no villains. Every person
has the taint that we all inherited from Adam,
and every person has some reflection of the
grace of God. There is no one who does not say
something foolish or ill-considered; and there
is no one who does not say something wise.
In other words there are no types, like "heavies,"
"juveniles," and "ingenues." As is the
case in nearly all the novels by its author, we
are constantly revising our opinions of the
characters; and we revise them, not because the
characters are untrue, but because we learn to
know them better. Human nature is consistent
only in its inconsistency. It is forever fluid
and dynamic; and although no individual has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
ever understood another, and least of all himself,
increasing knowledge helps to make us
certain of our uncertainty. No man will play
the part his friends have written for him. One
reason why Shakespeare was a first-rate and
Jonson a second-rate dramatist is because Jonson
created humours and Shakespeare created
individuals. Among all Shakespeare's personages,
Hamlet is the most interesting to readers
and the most baffling to commentators; because
the latter try to adjust him to a theory of
madness, weak will, or what not. Is not the
fact that he has never been understood by any
one and never will be, the strongest proof of
his reality? Some think he lacked backbone;
others insist he was all backbone; some think he
was mad; others that he only pretended to be
mad; while America's greatest Shakespearean
scholar said he was neither mad nor pretended
to be. A young gentleman of Hamlet's copious
temperament, placed as he was amid natural
and supernatural forces, might easily at times
seem to illustrate any one of the above appraisals.
Indeed I suppose the sanest and most
resolute among us seem at times to lack either
resolution or sanity or both.</p>

<p>The more complex a character, the less de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>pendable
he is. And everybody has some
complexity. Even quiet Horatio, beloved of
Hamlet for his steady self-control, tried to
commit suicide.</p>

<p>Every fine novel and every fine drama must
of course illustrate the law of causation&mdash;the
principle of sufficient reason. But characters
that run in grooves are not human. In <i>Richard
Baldock</i>, we have, as we so often have in the
work of Archibald Marshall, strife between
father and son&mdash;a kind of civil war. This war,
like many others, is begotten of misunderstanding.
There is not only the inevitable divergence
between the older and the younger generation,
there is the divergence between two
powerful individualities. We at first sympathize
wholly with the son. We say to ourselves
that if any man is foolish enough to sacrifice all
his joy in life to a narrow creed, why, after all,
that is his affair; it is only when he attempts
to impose this cheerless and barren austerity
on others, that we raise the flag of revolt. At
the deathbed of the young mother, one of the
most memorable scenes in our author's books,
we are quite certain that we shall never forgive
the inflexible bigot; this hatred for him is nourished
when he attempts to crush the son as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
did crush his wife. Yet, as the story develops,
and we see more deeply into the hearts of all
the characters, we understand how the chasm
between father and son is finally crossed. It is
crossed by the only durable bridge in the world&mdash;the
bridge of love, which beareth all things.</p>

<p>Tolerance&mdash;when based not on indifference,
but on sympathy&mdash;is tolerant even of intolerance.</p>

<h2>V</h2></div>


<p>In 1907 appeared one of the most characteristic
of Mr. Marshall's novels, <i>Exton
Manor</i>, which he began to write the day
after he finished <i>Richard Baldock</i>. It was
naturally impossible for any well-read reviewer
to miss the likeness to Anthony Trollope. If
I believed in the transmigration of souls, I
should believe that Archibald Marshall was a
reincarnation of Trollope, and William De
Morgan a reincarnation of Dickens. In an
interesting preface written for the American
edition, Mr. Marshall manfully says that he has
not only tried to follow Anthony Trollope, "but
the whole body of English novelists of his date,
who introduced you to a large number of people,
and left you with the feeling that you knew
them all intimately, and would have found yourself
welcome in their society. That particular
note of intimacy seems to be lacking in the fiction
of the present day, and I should like to
have it back."</p>

<p>This instantly raises the question of Victor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>ianism,
to some a stumbling-block, to some foolishness.
For my part, if I did not believe that
the best Victorian fiction was superior to contemporary
work, I should not be so hearty an
admirer of Archibald Marshall. Indeed the
best Victorian novels surpass our best twentieth
century novels in the one respect where
we chiefly plume ourselves on our claim to
attention&mdash;I mean in the matter of sincerity.
We talk about sincerity all the time, but we
protest too much; the essence of sincerity is
present perhaps more often in art, as it is
in life, where its profession is least urgent.
Henry James, in the fragment of autobiography
called <i>The Middle Years</i>, wisely though
oracularly remarked, "Phenomena may be interesting,
thank goodness, without being phenomena
of elegant expression or of any other
form of restless smartness, and when once type
is strong, when once it plays up from deep
sources, every show of its sincerity delivers us
a message and we hang, to real suspense, on
its continuance of energy, on its again and yet
again consistently acquitting itself. So it keeps
in tune, and, as the French adage says, <i>c'est le
ton qui fait la chanson</i>. The mid-Victorian
London was sincere&mdash;that was a vast virtue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a vast appeal; the contemporary is sceptical,
and most so when most plausible."</p>

<p>On a summer day in 1914, I had the pleasure
of a ten-mile drive over the hills with one of
the wisest old men in America&mdash;Andrew D.
White. I remember his saying that one of
the most fortunate things that could happen
to America would be a general ambition on the
part of the more educated classes to look forward
as to a goal in life to making a permanent
home in the country. He said that in America
men who make a little money move into the city
as soon as possible; whereas in England, whenever
a man makes a competence in the city he
usually establishes a home in the country. No
one can read the novels of Mr. Marshall without
feeling that his books are so to speak based
on this ideal; he repeatedly insists that life in
the country is the true life for thoughtful men
and women, and that the most delectable season
for the solid enjoyment of it is the winter.
Nay, he takes the position&mdash;a position also occupied
by one of our ablest American novelists,
Dorothy Canfield&mdash;that the most favourable locality
for studying human nature is the small
country village. He says, "Life in such a community
as is depicted in <i>Exton Manor</i> is just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as typical of English social habits as it was in
Trollope's day. The tendency of those who
have hitherto worked on the land to drift into
the towns is not shared by the more leisured
classes. Their tendency is all the other way&mdash;to
forsake the towns for the country&mdash;and improved
methods of communication keep them
more in touch with the world than they would
have been fifty years ago. But in spite of this
increased dependency upon the outside world,
English country life is still intensely local in
its personal interests, and quite legitimately so,
for it must be remembered that, if the man who
lives in a fairly populous country village comes
across fewer people than the man who lives
in a town, he knows all about those whom he
does come across, and his acquaintances represent
a far greater variety of type and class
than is met with where types and classes tend
to stratify. You have, in fact, in a typical
country parish, a microcosm of English social
life, and there is, ready to the hand of the realistic
novelist, material from which he can draw
as much interest and variety as he is able to
make use of."</p>

<p>In another important question which concerns
the art of the novelist, I might applaud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Mr. Marshall's dictum more unreservedly if I
did not happen to know of a gigantic witness
against him. In forestalling gossipy identification
of his leading characters in <i>Exton Manor</i>,
he says, "It is not a novelist's business to draw
portraits, but to create living figures, and the
nearer he gets to the first the farther off will
he be from the second." This certainly sounds
well; but unfortunately for its universal application,
practically all of the characters in <i>Anna
Karenina</i> are accurate portraits.</p>

<h2>VI</h2></div>


<p>To all those who have not yet read a single
work by our author, I would counsel them
to begin with <i>The Squire's Daughter</i>, and
then take up&mdash;with particular care to preserve
the correct sequence&mdash;<i>The Eldest Son</i>, <i>The
Honour of the Clintons</i>, <i>The Old Order Changeth</i>
[English title, <i>Rank and Riches</i>]. These
four stories deal with the family and family
affairs of the Clintons, and together with a
separate book, <i>The Greatest of These</i> [English
title, <i>Roding Rectory</i>], belong to Mr. Marshall's
best period, the years from 1909 to 1915.
When I say the best period, I mean the most
fruitful up to the present moment in 1918. He
is in the prime of life, and it is to be hoped
that he may yet surpass himself; but since 1915,
perhaps owing to the obsession of the war, he
has not done so. <i>Watermeads</i> (1916) is a
charming story, and in <i>Abington Abbey</i> (1917),
and its sequel, <i>The Graftons</i> (1918), he has introduced
us to another interesting family; but
neither of these books reaches the level main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>tained
by the Clinton tetralogy, nor penetrates
so deeply into the springs of life and conduct
as his most powerful work, <i>The Greatest of
These</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall began <i>The Squire's Daughter</i>
as a long "short story," starting with what is
now Chapter XII, <i>Food and Raiment</i>. He fell
in love with his characters, as many a novelist
has done, and expanded the narrative. Then
he wrote <i>The Eldest Son</i>, which is the best of
the four books. Yet it was not a success in
England, and at present both <i>The Squire's
Daughter</i> and <i>The Eldest Son</i> are out of print
in their home country; they are, however, having
a daily-increasing circulation in America,
which is bound to resurrect them in Great Britain.
For that matter most of Mr. Marshall's
novels are more widely known and certainly
more appreciated in the United States than in
the land of their nativity. In <i>The Honour of
the Clintons</i>, the author's intention was to
"take up the old Squire, see what all his generations
of gentility and honour, and all his
conviction that he is of superior clay, amount
to when he is touched with personal disgrace."
He discovered, as Dickens must have discovered
in writing the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
hero turned out rather better than he thought
he would. This third book in the series was
written under inspiration, completed in six
weeks, and at the time came almost as near
satisfying the author as it always has satisfied
me. But a friend, with true English candour,
said to him, "All the ingredients of the cake are
there, but the cake hasn't risen." Anyhow,
the Squire rose, whether the cake did or not.</p>

<p>The final novel in the Clinton family, <i>The Old
Order Changeth</i>, shows the effect produced on
both Rank and Riches by the Great War. Mr.
Marshall began this story with many misgivings,
and it is still not one of his favourites,
chiefly because "there are so many beastly
people in it." But so long as I live it will hold
a secure place in my heart, for this is the first
work of the author's that I saw. Indeed I had
never heard of him until I picked up <i>The Old
Order Changeth</i>. I started to read it with no
conception of the keen delight in store; after
finishing it, I wrote to the publishers, "Who on
earth is Archibald Marshall? There is no one
like him in the world. Send me everything he
has written." Since that moment of exaltation,
I have read and reread the Clinton books, and
each time they seem better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>To read the Clinton stories is to be a welcome
guest in a noble old English country house, to
meet and to associate on terms of happy intimacy
with delightful, well-bred, clear-minded
men and women; to share the outdoor life of
healthful sport, and the pleasant conversation
around the open fire; to sharpen one's observation
of natural scenery in summer and in
winter, and in this way to make a permanent
addition to one's mental resources; to learn the
significance of good manners, tact, modesty,
kindly consideration, purity of heart&mdash;not by
wearisome precepts, but by their flower and
fruit in human action. To read these books
is not to dodge life, it is to have it more abundantly.</p>

<p>If, as Bacon said, a man dies as often as he
loses his friends, then he gains vitality by every
additional friendship. To know the Clinton
family and their acquaintances is not merely to
be let into the inner circle of English country
life, to discover for ourselves exactly what sort
of people English country folk are, to understand
what family tradition and ownership of
the land mean to them&mdash;it is to enlarge our own
range of experience and to increase our own
stock of genuine happiness, by adding to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
mental life true friends&mdash;and friends that are
always available. For often the friends of flesh
and blood cannot be reached when we need them
most; perhaps they are asleep, or away on a
journey; but the staunch old friends introduced
to us by novelists never deny themselves. Is
not this a fairly good reason why, among all
the novels we read, some at all events should be
selected for the immanent charm of their characters?
I know how uncritical it is to admire
any work of art that possesses the element of
cheerfulness; but suppose our reading of novels
were entirely confined to the works of Maxim
Gorki?</p>

<p>Why should we always select acquaintances
in fiction that we always avoid in real life? Is
it the same instinct that makes so many persons
love to go slumming?</p>

<p>There is perhaps rather too strong a flavour
of tea in these stories, but that no doubt is a
legitimate part of their realism. The sacred
rite of afternoon tea plays fully as big a part
in English fiction as it plays in English life.
Tea&mdash;which would be an intolerable interruption
to business or to golf among normal Americans&mdash;is
never superfluous to the British.
Among the hundreds of English novels that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
you have read, can you recall a single instance
where any character <i>declined</i> a cup of tea?
And, in terrible crises or trivial vexations, is
not the following exclamation familiar&mdash;"I
am dying for my tea!" I sometimes think
that if the house should be destroyed by fire
at three o'clock, half-past four would find the
family taking tea on the lawn. I remember, on
a voyage to Alaska, a vigorous old English
woman who appeared on deck every day between
four and five, and when she saw the circulation
of the china, a look of holy rapture
dawned in her eyes, and from her lips came
an ecstatic cry, "Ah, is there tea going?"
It must be wonderful to love anything on
earth so much as the English love their
tea.</p>

<p>Two months after writing the above paragraph,
I received testimony which delightfully
supports the view expressed. An Englishman
informs me, that after the big sea-fight of Jutland,
he had the privilege of conversing with an
English blue-jacket who was perched aloft during
the whole of that terrific experience. There
he remained under orders, in the thick of the
battle, with the bolts of death flying all about
him. On being asked how he felt, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
man exclaimed with a tone of regret, "Well, of
course, I had to miss my tea."</p>

<p>Not since Fielding's Squire Western has
there been a more vivid English country squire
than Mr. Marshall's Squire Clinton. The difference
between them is the difference between
the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries. He
is the man of the house, the head of the family,
and it is not until we have read all four of the
stories that we can obtain a complete view of
his character. He is a living, breathing man,
and we see the expression on his face, and hear
the tones of his voice, which his daughters imitate
so irresistibly. With all his pride and
prejudice, with all his childish irritableness, he
is the idol of the household. His skull is as
thick as English oak, but he has a heart of
gold. He is stupid, but never contemptible.
And when the war with Germany breaks out
in 1914, he rises to a magnificent climax in the
altercation with Armitage Brown. We hear in
his torrent of angry eloquence not merely the
voice of one man, but the combined voices of all
the generations that have developed him.</p>

<p>Yet while Mr. Marshall has made an outstanding
and unforgettable figure of the fox-hunting
Squire, it is in the portrayal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
women of the family that he shows his most
delicate art. This is possibly because his skill
as an artist is reinforced by profound sympathy.
The Squire is so obtuse that it has
never dawned upon his mind that his wife is
a thousand times cleverer than he, or that her
daily repression has in it anything savouring
of tragedy. In the third book, <i>The Honour of
the Clintons</i>, intense and prolonged suffering
begins to sharpen his dull sight; and the scenes
between the old pair are unspeakably tender
and beautiful. Mr. Marshall never preaches,
never tries to adorn the tale by pointing a
moral. But the wild escapade of the daughter
in the first of these stories, and the insistence
of the mother on a superior education for the
twins exhibit more clearly than any letter to
the <i>Times</i> could do, what the author thinks
about the difference between the position
women have held in English country homes
and the position they ought to have.</p>

<p>Of all his characters, perhaps those that the
reader will remember with the highest flood of
happy recollection are the twins, Joan and
Nancy. In the first novel, this wonderful pair
are aged thirteen; in the second, they are fifteen;
in the third, they are twenty-one. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Marshall is particularly skilful in the drawing
of young girls; and after one has read <i>Ann
Veronica</i>, I can think of no better antidote
than these Clinton books. Whatever may be
woman's place in the future, whatever she may
drink or smoke or wear or say or do, there
is one kind of girl that can never become unattractive;
and the Clinton twins illustrate that
kind. They are healthy, modest, quick-witted,
affectionate, high-spirited; when they come in
laughing and glowing from a game of tennis,
and take their places at the family tea-table,
they bring the breath of life into the room.</p>

<p>In <i>The Eldest Son</i>, which of the four delightful
books dealing with the Clinton family, I
find most delightful, there is a suggestion of
the author's attitude toward humanity in the
procession of candidates for governess that
passes before the penetrating eyes of Mrs.
Clinton. Her love for the old Starling&mdash;one of
the most original of Mr. Marshall's creations&mdash;has
not blinded Mrs. Clinton to the latter's
incompetence for the task of training so alert a
pair as the twins. Of the women who present
themselves for this difficult position, not one is
wholly desirable; and it is plain that Mrs. Clinton
knows in advance that this will be the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
She is not looking for an ideal teacher, for such
curiosities are not to be found on our planet;
the main requisite is brains, and she selects
finally the candidate whom many society women
would immediately dismiss as impossible, the
uncompromising, hard-headed, sexless Miss
Phipps, who has about as much amenity as a
steamroller. Miss Phipps bristles with faults;
but they are the faults that spring from excess
of energy, from a devotion to scholarship so
exclusive that the minor graces and minor
pleasures of life have received in her daily
scheme even less than their due. But the twins
already possess everything lacking in the composition
of their teacher; what they need is
not a sweet, sympathetic companion, what they
need is what nearly every one needs, mental
discipline, mental training, and an increase in
knowledge and ideas. In this dress-parade of
candidates we have a miniature parade of
humanity in the large; no one is faultless; but
those who have an honest mind and an honest
character have something essential. And who
knows but what the shrewd and deep-hearted
Mrs. Clinton did not also see that in the association
of this mirthless expert with two young
incarnations of vitality and vivacity, both par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>ties
to the contract might learn something of
value? Miss Phipps is about to discover that
the country-side in winter has resources entirely
unguessed at by her bookish soul; that
there are many of her countrymen and country-women
who find in outdoor sport a secret of
health and happiness.</p>



<p class="i2 p2">Her bedroom was in the front of the house, and she
had heard, without much heeding them, the wheels and
the beat of horse-hoofs and the voices outside. Now she
began to be a little curious as to what was going on, and
rose and drew up her blind and looked out.</p>

<p class="i2">The scene was quite new to her, and in spite of herself
she exclaimed at it. Immediately beyond the wide
gravel sweep in front of the house was the grass of the
park, where the whole brave show of the South Meadshire
Hunt was collected. It is doubtful if she had ever
seen a pack of hounds in her life, and she watched them
as if fascinated. Presently, at some signal which she
had not discerned, the huntsman and the whips turned
and trotted off with them, and behind them streamed all
the horsemen and horsewomen, the carriages and carts,
and the people on foot, until the whole scene which had
been so full of life and colour was entirely empty of all
human occupation, and there was only the damp grass
of the park and the big bare trees under the pearly grey
of the winter sky. She saw the Squire ride off on his
powerful horse, and admired his sturdy erect carriage,
and she saw Dick and Virginia, side by side, Humphrey,
the pink of sartorial hunting perfection, Mrs. Clinton
in her carriage, with Miss Dexter by her side and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
twins opposite to her, and for a moment wished she had
accepted her invitation to make one of the party,
although she did not in the least understand where they
were going to, or what they were going to do when they
got there. All this concourse of apparently well-to-do
and completely leisured people going seriously about a
business so remote from any of the interests in life that
she had known struck her as entirely strange and inexplicable.
She might have been in the midst of some odd
rites in an unexplored land. The very look of the
country in its winter dress was strange to her, for she
was a lifelong Londoner and the country to her only
meant a place where one spent summer holidays.</p>

<h2>VII</h2></div>


<p>The novel <i>Watermeads</i> (1916), particularly
welcome to me because the friend
who wore a grotesque mask in <i>Upsidonia</i>
showed his healthy, agreeable, English face
again, opens characteristically with the entire
family gathered around the tea-table in a sunlit
room in an old manor house. This story is
mainly concerned with the waxing and waning
of a marriage-engagement; the rich fiancée
seems well enough among her own people and
in her own environment; her lack of breeding
appears with steadily increasing emphasis when
she is brought into the circle of the squire's
household. The restraint shown by Mr. Marshall
in contrasting her with the people among
whom she is expected to live is worthy of the
highest praise. There is nothing exaggerated,
not a trace of burlesque; little touches, shades
of speech and conduct, the expression at the
corners of the girl's mouth when she is displeased
or unsatisfied, all combine to lower the
temperature in her lover's heart. Nor is there
anything snobbish in this increasing coldness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
No matter how important may be a difference
in manners or social breeding, love could make
a happy fusion; it is, however, not in one act
of villainy, but in many trifles light as air that
the young woman is finally, even to the myopic
eyes of passion, revealed as wholly selfish.</p>

<p>Two accidents&mdash;youth and cash&mdash;give to this
girl an assurance that finally makes her odious;
but women who have neither can be equally offensive.
Her prospective mother-in-law, the
squire's wife, parades the decline in the family's
finances so obtrusively that she becomes
as tiresome as a flapping curtain. When Lord
Kirby is shown by her through the ancestral
home, he escapes with a sense of enormous relief,
saying to his wife, "That's an awful
woman. You hear about people being purse-proud,
but she seems to be empty-purse-proud,
and I don't know that that isn't worse. If
people are as hard up as that they ought to
hide it."</p>

<p>In <i>Abington Abbey</i> (1917) and <i>The Graftons</i>
(1918) we have really one book, and the last
page of the sequel makes me hope that the history
of this charming family may be continued&mdash;I
don't care through how many volumes.
Mr. Grafton is a gentleman, and the way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
which he settles the various problems of family
discipline and the affairs of the estate springs
from his unerring good sense. His daughters
adore their widower-father, but each in her own
manner. And though they are all attractive, I
know which one I like the best.</p>

<p>Mr. Marshall published with <i>The Graftons</i> an
exceedingly interesting Introduction, containing
a defense of his methods which is not
needed by intelligent readers, but which may
enlighten those who do not understand what
he is about. In a personal letter, however, he
expressed himself in words that I like better
than his printed apologia. "The Grafton family
isn't so rich in varied interest as the Clinton
family, but I hope they will make their friends.
I think they are as 'nice' a family as any I've
drawn. I set out simply to show them in their
country home, and make their country neighbours
display themselves in the light of their
critical humour, without much idea of a story.
It turned into something rather different, and
I'm not quite sure about it yet. And it has
taken two books to work it out."</p>

<p>Now the reason why I like this ink-epistle
better than the formal preface is because in
the latter Mr. Marshall seemed to think it nec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>essary
to reply to those critics who said he
ought to discuss in his novels the economic
questions concerned with the tenure of the
land. If he should by some evil temptation
make economic questions the basis of his stories
of English country life, he would commit the
cardinal sin that has corrupted so much of contemporary
fiction, the sin that I condemned at
the outset of this essay. The most conspicuous
element in his art is Charm. If some one
should persuade him that he ought to become
more "serious," his novels would lose their
atmosphere; and he might find himself writing
like that earnest student of modern movements,
Mrs. Humphry Ward.</p>

<p>I am aware that the most insulting epithet
that can be applied to a book, or a play, or a
human being is the word "Puritan"; and I
remember reading a review somewhere of
<i>Abington Abbey</i> which commented rather satirically
on the interview between Grafton and
Lassigny, and most satirically of all on the conclusion
of the interview, which left the stiff,
prejudiced, puritanical British parent in possession
of the field. But once more, Mr. Marshall
is not trying to prove a thesis; he is
representing the Englishman and the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>man
in a hot debate, where neither is right
and neither is wrong, but where each is partly
right and partly wrong. Each says in the heat
of the contest something injudicious, even as
men do when they are angry. But when Lassigny
literally takes French leave, we do not
care who has scored the most points; the real
winner is the one who is not present&mdash;the girl
herself. For when two men fight about a
woman, as they do somewhere every day, the
truly important question is not, which man
wins the fight? The only real question is,
does the woman win?</p>

<p>It will never do to make generalizations from
merely one of Mr. Marshall's novels. If we
had only <i>Abington Abbey</i>, we might imagine
that he detested the clergy, for the clergyman
in this book is surely detestable; but in <i>The
Greatest of These</i> there are two clergymen who
are admirable characters, and a third who is by
no means wholly or even mainly evil. Like an
honest student of life, Mr. Marshall never considers
a man as a representative of a business,
but as a human being. No man is good because
he is a clergyman; but it would be well perhaps
if every member of that highest of all professions
were a clergyman because he was good.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2></div>


<p>There is an unconscious double meaning
in the American name given to the novel
published in 1914, <i>The Greatest of These</i>,
for it can be taken not only in the Pauline significance,
but as the greatest of these books we
are considering. It is the most ambitious and
on the whole the most effective of its author's
productions, containing also the essence of
his religion&mdash;charity contrasted with opinions.
We have an illustration of his favourite method
of portraying the shade and shine of human
character by placing in opposition two leading
representatives of two large classes of nominal
Christians&mdash;a clergyman of the Church of England
and a minister of the Dissenters. Mr.
Marshall never wrote a better first chapter.
The reader is instantly aware that he has in his
hands a masterpiece. Every leading character
is introduced in the opening chapter either in
person or in allusive conversation, and we know
that Mr. Marshall has what most novelists seek
in vain&mdash;a real plot. This book, which eventually
rises to the highest spiritual altitude at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>tained
thus far by its author, begins on a note
of sordid sex-tragedy, as unusual in the stories
of Mr. Marshall as a picture like the Price
household is in the work of Jane Austen; here
it serves to bring forward the forthright and
self-satisfied Anglican, who little dreams of
his approaching humiliation; he is brought into
conflict with a kind of Zeal-of-the-land Busy,
whose aggressive self-righteousness is to be
softened by the very man who he hoped would
harden it. Here too, as in <i>Exton Manor</i>, we
come as near as we ever come in Mr. Marshall's
books to meeting a villain&mdash;in each case it is a
woman with a serpent's tongue.</p>

<p>The time-element in <i>The Greatest of These</i> is
managed with consummate skill. So far as
the novel has a hero, it is the Rev. Dr. Merrow.
He does not appear in Roding until the one-hundred-and-sixty-third
page, but there is so
much talk, for and against him, that the reader
awaits his arrival at the railway station with
fully as much eagerness as any of the village
gossips. And then, owing to the Doctor's
fatigue from the journey, the reader is as
baffled as the parishioners. It is quite impossible
to discover what manner of man he is.
The author refuses to help us, preferring to let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his leading character reveal himself without
any manipulation behind the scenes. This
revelation is gradual, made up of many little
details of speech and behaviour, as it would be
in real life.</p>

<p>But although the personality of the man is
not clear until more than half of the book has
passed, the ninth chapter, which shows him in
action in London as a public institution, is one
of the most powerful pieces of prose Mr. Marshall
has ever composed. He writes as if inspired
by the theme. Not only is it a magnificent
description of a great occasion, its dramatic
power is immensely heightened because
we see it through the eyes of a young ritualist,
to whom it is as strange&mdash;and at first as repellent&mdash;as
some vulgar heathen observance. But
gradually distaste changes to interest, and interest
to enthusiasm. Such passages as the
following are entirely unlike the ordinary current
of Mr. Marshall's style, but it is a proof
that he can reach the heights when the occasion
calls.</p>


<p class="p2 i2">There came more of these sentences. The spark had
caught; the furnace was beginning to glow. George
gazed at the preacher with his own face alight. His
surroundings were forgotten.... If this was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
kind of preaching that had brought Dr. Merrow his
great reputation, then he understood its appeal, and
was himself moved by it. It came from something beyond
creeds, far beyond differences in methods of worship.
It had been heard in all ages of the Church,
amidst the splendours of mediæval superstition, as in
the crude barrenness of modern revivalism. The spirit
moved on the face of the waters; the stagnancy of mere
words was broken; there was life and healing in them.</p>

<p class="i2">The words came faster. The voice grew stronger, and
took on a different tone, as if on an organ a touch of
reed had been added to diapason. The slightly bent
figure became straighter, the worn face younger. The
preacher began to use his hands&mdash;thin, flexible, nervous
hands, which seemed to clutch at deep truths, and
fling them out for the world to take hold of. Soon the
burning words came in a torrent, as of a rushing mass
of water of irresistible force, yet bound within its directing
channel. Every now and then they sank to a
deep calm, but were still infused with the same concentrative
power. Such words had stirred men's minds
and souls in long past ages. Spoken on bare hillsides
underneath the symbol of faith, they had converted
kingdoms. Flung forth over throngs of rough fighting
men, they had turned bloodshed and rapine into
righteous crusades. Their power was older than that
of Christianity itself. In the dim ages of religious
history it had singled out Aaron for the priesthood, and
put him above Moses, the warrior leader. Later, it had
burst the bonds of the priesthood itself, and winged the
utterances of great prophets.</p>

<p class="p2">Every page that we turn in this extraordinary
book lessens the distance not only in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
but in sympathy between the Rector and
the Pastor. The orthodox evangelical chapel
orator is drawn with just the insight one
would superficially <i>not</i> expect from a man of
Mr. Marshall's birth, breeding, and environment.
He is certainly the author's finest
achievement, even finer than Squire Clinton,
for he is more difficult to draw. The Rev. Dr.
Merrow must be added to Chaucer's Poore Persoun
and to Goldsmith's Village Preacher as
one more permanent clerical figure in imaginative
literature.</p>

<p>Lesser personages in this story are given
with the same care in detail, until we feel their
presence as personal friends. The curate, the
Rev. George Barton, so completely misunderstood
by Mrs. Merrow, is an almost flawless portrait.
His healthy, athletic outdoor nature and
the development of his inner life are both presented
with subtle, delicate strokes of the pen
possible only to an artist of distinction.</p>

<p>It is interesting to contemplate side by side
in the reader's mind the wife of the Rector and
the wife of the Pastor. Both are good women&mdash;their
only similarity. Lady Ruth, a born
aristocrat, with a "temperamental inability to
comport herself as the busy wife of a busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
clergyman" is one of the most gracious and
lovely figures created by our novelist, which
means that her charm is irresistible. The less
admirable, but more energetic wife of Dr. Merrow
is so perfect a representative of the busy
city pastor's helpmate that we can only wonder
how it is possible to put on paper any creation
so real. There is not a false touch in this picture.
William Allingham wrote in his diary
after reading one of Browning's poems,
"Bravo, Browning!" Upon finishing <i>The
Greatest of These</i>, which I confidently call a
great novel, I could hardly refrain from a
shout of applause.</p>

<h2>IX</h2></div>


<p>Mr. Marshall is a twentieth century
novelist, because he is happily yet alive,
and because he writes of twentieth century
scenes and characters; but he is apart
from the main currents of twentieth century
fiction, standing indeed in the midst of
the stream like a commemorative pillar to Victorian
art. He has never written historical romance,
which dominated the novel at the beginning
of our century; he has never written the
"life" novel&mdash;beginning with the hero's birth
and travelling with plotless chronology, the
type most in favour since the year 1906; he has
never written a treatise and called it a novel,
as so many of his contemporaries have done.
Every one of his novels, except the two unfortunate
burlesques, is a good story, with a good
plot and living characters; and he has chosen
to write about well-bred people, because those
are the people he knows best.</p>

<p>It is also well to remember, that although
his best novels are parochial, he himself is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
citizen of the world. He has seen the North
Cape, he has lived in the Australian bush, in
various European cities, and has traveled extensively
in America. One reason why he can
describe English country life so clearly is because
he sees it in the proper perspective. He
is at home in any community on earth.</p>

<p>I call him a realistic novelist, because his
realism is of the highest and most convincing
kind&mdash;it constantly reminds us of reality. I
cannot see why a well-constructed story, that
deals mainly with attractive men and women,
and ends on a note of robust cheerfulness,
should have any less right to the adjective
"realistic" than an ill-arranged transcript of
the existence of creatures living amongst poverty,
filth, and crime. And so far as Mr. Marshall's
Victorian reticence on questions of sex
is concerned, this strengthens his right to the
title Realist. As Henry James said, the moment
you insist that animalism must have its
place in works of art, there almost always
seems to be no place for anything else. If a
novelist is to represent real life, he must make
subordinate and incidental what in some
novels dominates every page. If a writer is
to describe events as they really happen, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
portray men and women as they really are, to
create living characters that can be recognized
in modern society, he ought to emphasize in
his art what life itself emphasizes&mdash;the difference
between man and the lower animals. The
curious thing is that in many so-called realistic
novels it is impossible to distinguish between
human beings and the beasts of the field; the
well-understood likeness is stressed so heavily
that not only the individual, but even the type
is lost. One can hardly call so total an absence
of discrimination true art. Even the most elementary
man or woman is less elementary than
a beast; and is it not true that the greater the
complexity, the greater the skill required to
report it truly?</p>

<p>And here is a strange thing. It is only in
stories of human beings that our would-be
realists insist that animalism should be most
frankly and most minutely portrayed. When
we come to dog-stories&mdash;of which there are
many&mdash;the element of sex is as a rule wholly
omitted. Yet surely this is more salient in the
life of a dog than in the life of a man.</p>

<p>Archibald Marshall is a realist. He represents
cultivated men and women as we saw
them yesterday, and as we shall see them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>morrow.
He seldom disappoints us, for among
all living novelists, whilst he is not the greatest,
he is the most reliable. It is difficult to analyse
the extraordinary charm of his stories, for they
are simpler than simplicity. He takes us literally
into the bosom of a family, where each
member has a distinct individuality, and the
novel progresses like beautiful voices with
orchestral accompaniment&mdash;each individual in
turn singing an air, while the family fortunes
supply the harmony. To read his books is to
associate with people whom it is highly important
to know&mdash;not because of their social
standing, but because of their solid worth. His
good characters are fundamentally good. They
are seldom brilliant, and almost never reformers.
They are more altruistic than philanthropic.
They possess the fine old virtues
of purity, wholesomeness, generosity, loving-kindness,
honesty, loyalty, tact, consideration;
such persons are always lovable in life, which
is why they are lovable in these books. His
heroes are not saviours of society, they are
simply good companions, be the weather fair
or foul; and we are never sickened by the diaphanous
veneer of sentimentality. His villains
seldom break the law of the land, and do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
reek of melodrama. They are inconsiderate,
garrulous, inopportune, stupid, meddling, officiously
helpful, which is sometimes worse than
deliberate hostility. Mrs. Prentice in <i>Exton
Manor</i> is his most offensive specimen, and according
to the wisdom of the Book of Proverbs,
she is one of the four things for which the earth
is disquieted&mdash;"an odious woman when she is
married." These respectable villains, who
often cause more suffering than professional
criminals, receive the punishment of unpopularity.
But in most of his characters the elements
are more kindly mixed. We have on
every page the delight of recognition&mdash;the figures
are so perfectly drawn that we are under
the illusion that they are alive.</p>

<p>Although these stories are never explicitly
didactic, they are ethically as well as artistically
true. Beneath the surface of light conversation
and trivial incident we find an idea
that works for righteousness. This idea is so
variously and so frequently illustrated that I
think it must be the foundation of the author's
philosophy of life and conduct. He would have
us believe that different individuals, different
social classes, different communities dislike and
distrust each other mainly through ignorance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
He would not say in the old phrase, to understand
is to forgive, he would say something
without any taint of condescension, something
finer and more fruitful&mdash;to understand is to
respect, to admire, to love. The inefficient aristocrat
and the pushing millionaire despise each
other, the haughty Churchman and the pious
Dissenter distrust each other's motives until
they are brought by the force of circumstances
into an unescapable daily intimacy; the result
of which to both is surprising and agreeable.
Apparently what we all need is more imagination,
more intelligence. These novels make
a combined attack on the last infirmity of both
noble and ignoble minds, that last citadel of
stupidity&mdash;Prejudice.</p>
